//explaination:
// In this test, we are testing the CameraScreen widget. We are checking if the Open Camera button is displayed and if the _pickImage function is called when the button is tapped.
// We are using mock objects for CameraAccess and StorageService to simulate the behavior of these classes. We are also using the mocktail library to create these mock objects.
// We then pump the CameraScreen widget into the test environment and verify that the Open Camera button is displayed.
