//explaination:
//In the first test, we check if the TeamDetailPage widget displays the team information correctly. We create a TeamDetailPage widget with some dummy data and check if the team name, description, key, and slug are displayed correctly.
//In the second test, we check if the _leaveTeam function is called when the "Leave Team" button is pressed. We create a TeamDetailPage widget with a mock onLeaveTeam callback and check if the _leaveTeam function is called when the button is pressed.
//In the third test, we check if a loading indicator is displayed while the _isLoading flag is true. We create a TeamDetailPage widget and simulate a button press to trigger the _leaveTeam function. We then check if a CircularProgressIndicator widget is displayed while the _isLoading flag is true.
//These tests cover the basic functionality of the TeamDetailPage widget, including displaying team information, handling button presses, and showing a loading indicator. You can add more tests to cover other scenarios and edge cases as needed.
//The tests use the mockito library to mock dependencies like the FlutterSecureStorage and http.Client classes. This allows us to test the widget in isolation without making actual network requests or accessing the device's secure storage. The tests also use the mockito when and thenAnswer functions to mock the behavior of these dependencies and simulate different scenarios like successful API calls and error responses.
//Overall, these tests provide good coverage of the TeamDetailPage widget and help ensure that it works correctly under different conditions. You can run these tests using the flutter test command in the terminal or by using the test runner in your IDE.
